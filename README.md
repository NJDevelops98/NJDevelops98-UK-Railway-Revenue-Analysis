# NJDevelops98-UK-Railway-Revenue-Analysis

This project showcases an Excel Dashboard designed to analyze and visualize key performance metrics for a UK Railways Revenue dataset. By transforming raw data into intuitive charts, pivot tables, and summary visuals, this dashboard provides stakeholders with a quick and comprehensive overview of revenue, ticket sales, delay reasons, and customer behavior trends. The primary aims of this project are to:

- Highlight Sales & Revenue Trends – Understand how revenues fluctuate by month and time of day.

- Identify Common Delay Factors – Pinpoint which factors (e.g., weather, technical issues) cause service disruptions.

- Improve Customer Insights – Examine ticket type preferences, payment methods, and peak travel times.

Included in this repository are the following components:
-Raw Data File – The dataset that serves as the backbone of the analysis.
-Dashboard Screenshot – A visual snapshot illustrating key metrics and charts.
-Key Findings & Analysis – A text file providing an in-depth narrative on how the data was interpreted and what actions might be taken based on the insights.

This project underscores the potential of Excel’s built-in capabilities—pivot tables, charts, and slicers—to transform large data sets into actionable insights. It may serve as a valuable template for anyone looking to drive data-driven decision-making in transportation, logistics, or other service-focused sectors.
